  = Issues faced in wifi  connectivity
     👉️ Not connecting to wifi
     👉️ Wifi connected but slow internet
     👉️ 💫 [most important] We are connected to the internet and the connection is working properly and the connection is still intact but you don't recieve the internet.
        - More specifically speaking while running the ping www.google.com command in between we get the message `Destination Host Unreachable`
        - 🌬️ This problem can be simulated to being connected but showing `No Internet` in Windows.
  = Reasons 🤦
  	 👉️ Old and outdated wifi chipset
  	 👉️ Manufacturing Defect
  	 👉️ Outdated Driver problem
  	 👉️ Chipset Driver Compatibility Problem [Intel cannon chipset]
  	 👉️ 💫 Power management restricting the power to wifi chipset
  1. Chaning the power management.
  	- modify the file at /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
  	 -> Put these into the file to disable power management.
		[connection]
		wifi.powersave = 2
  2. Change dns server to google's DNS Server.
